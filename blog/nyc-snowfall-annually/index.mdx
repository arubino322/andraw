Data: I forgot, a combination of monthly historical temperature averages + snowfall totals.

Annual snowfall fluctuates over time, and looking at the chart, I'd argue that overall snowfall levels
are taking a dip compared to late 1800s & early 1900s. 

**BIGGER PICTURE**

This is my first blog post! Isn't it *great*?
But really, this is my first blog post. I had grand ideas of making visualizations with multiple axes,
variety of colors, and interactive features. But D3 is hard, and for the purposes of publishing content
(__any__ content), I've decided to keep it simple.

Everything here is new. This gatsby blog is new. I have little to no experience with markdown nor React.
D3 seems harder than it should be, but I'd like to stick through it.

My overall goals:
* Develop better habits around coding. Even if it's only 30 min/day.
* Consistently add content/posts, regardless of how small.
* Improve my writing.


Inspirations:
* https://roadtolarissa.com/
* https://www.chartr.co/
* Kareem Abdul Jabbar's substack.
